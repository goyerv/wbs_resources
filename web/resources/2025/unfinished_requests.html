Runners are strongly advised to monitor the duration of each request closely and aim to complete their tasks within the time initially agreed upon. When handling delivery runs, it's important to avoid making purchases too early unless they are confident the request will not be canceled, particularly before the 30% time mark. Retaining receipts, original packaging, and communication logs for any purchases made can serve as vital evidence in the event of a dispute.">
