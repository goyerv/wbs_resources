Problem-related stress can make people seem rude even when they aren't. \n\nDo not humiliate someone or make them feel less than for something that was said or did that was an honest mistake. A person can really have no idea about something and that's okay. Don't take it upon yourself to carefully point out all of the flaws of that person to make a point. Try not to digress. Stay on topic always. \n\n If you have no idea, say so! Or better still, say nothing. A smart-sounding but wrong answer is worse than no answer at all. Don't lead anyone on goose chases to appear smart. Be humble, be honest; set good examples for everyone. \n\nIf you can't provide a solution, that's fine. Just don't add to the problem. Don't hinder or make it difficult for other members of the community to be of help. Don't be sarcastic as it might be wrongfully interpreted. \n\nAsking probing questions to reveal more details about a problem is a good technique that enables the querent learn something new about their problem. Turn a bad question into a good one. \n\nLet your answer be helpful to the whole community. Whenever you come across a question, let your response to that question not just be for the querent but for the entire community so that a question like that never has to come up again. Thoroughly think about a question and all its possible variants, then give a detailed answer that addresses not just the querent's question but also all its possible variants. In doing this, you have created a reference for the community.\n\n'''
